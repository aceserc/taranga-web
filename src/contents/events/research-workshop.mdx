The **Research Workshop Continuation** is a collaborative initiative by **EXCESS** and **ACES**, aimed at building upon the foundation laid by the previous **Research Workshop**. This session focuses on helping students and researchers understand **how to begin writing**, **structure their research articles**, and **navigate the path to publication** in academic or professional platforms.

### What to Expect

- **From Idea to Paper**: Learn how to turn your project or concept into a research-worthy topic.
- **Structured Writing Guidance**: Understand the key sections of a research paper — abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion.
- **Publication Insights**: Get practical knowledge on choosing journals, writing abstracts, and submitting for publication.
- **Expert Mentorship**: Interact with experienced mentors and researchers from EXCESS and ACES.
- **Collaborative Learning**: Work alongside peers in a guided environment to strengthen academic writing and research presentation skills.

The **Research Workshop Continuation** serves as a bridge between innovation and communication — empowering students to express their technical ideas through impactful, well-written research publications.
