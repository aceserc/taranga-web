The **Hardware Hackathon** is an intense and creative competition organized by **EXCESS**, where participants put their **IoT** and **microcontroller** knowledge into action to develop **innovative hardware solutions**. Combining learning from the **IoT and Microcontroller Trainings**, this event pushes students to design and prototype systems that solve real-world problems — all within a **closed, time-restricted, and highly competitive environment**.

### What to Expect

- **Real-World Problem Solving**: Build hardware projects addressing real challenges using IoT and embedded systems.
- **Hands-on Prototyping**: Use microcontrollers, sensors, and circuits to bring ideas to life within limited time.
- **Team Collaboration**: Work in small groups to ideate, design, and present working prototypes.
- **Competitive Environment**: Experience the thrill of engineering under pressure while competing for recognition.
- **Innovation Awards**: Win exciting prizes and recognition for creativity, functionality, and impact.

The **Hardware Hackathon** is where imagination meets engineering — a platform for students to prove that innovative ideas can become working realities in just a matter of hours.
